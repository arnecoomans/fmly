# CMNS FMLY
Fmly is an annotated photodump, used to create some structure in a vast set of historic family-documents such as photos, news-articles and other snippets of data.

## Features

### User rights
Assign user rights to view people, tags, comments or notes. If something cannot be accessed, the references to that object are also hidden.

### People
An image can be tagged with displayed people. This adds some relevant context to a image, and it is easy to find other images with this person.
Parents can be linked, so the family relations and family tree can be built two ways, one generation up and down when viewing a person.

### Tags
Add a tag to describe context of the image, and link the image to other images with the same context.

### Dating
When a date is known for an image, this information makes it easy to find other images around the same time period. Decades are used.
